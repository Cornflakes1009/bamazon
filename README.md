Bamazon is a command line interface store where you can buy stuff you don't need and probably don't want. 

Start by typing in node.js bamazonCustomer.js and pressing 'enter.' You will then be prompted to select the item you want. Type in and number and press 'enter.' A prompt will ask you how many of that item you want. If the number you selected is in stock, your purchase will go through. If there isn't enough stock, you'll be told what the current stock is and to reduce the amount of that item that you want.
